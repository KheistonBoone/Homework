1. Keep printing integers in multiples of 5 as long as integers are less than 100

2. Using a while loop print  integers between 0 and 20. All numbers divisible by 2 should be multiplied by 3 before they are output. All other integers should not be output. 

Hint: use Modulo

3. Using a while loop, print out all prime numbers between 0 - 20

4. Write a for loop for the given output:
 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

5. create a loop that outputs multiples of 3 starting at 6 ending at 60.
